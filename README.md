## Dependencies
- terminal with sixel support
- fzf

### Arch Linux
I personally use `konsole` because it supports both RTL and sixel
```Bash
sudo pacman -Sy konsole
```
Other dependencies:
```Bash
sudo pacman -Sy fzf
```

## Getting started
Scripts including the installer itself have help pages
```Bash
./install --help
```
